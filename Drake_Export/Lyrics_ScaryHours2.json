different body (Facts)\nMansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)\nLemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')\nIf you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it\nUsed to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all\nAnd bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it\nAnd if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it\nI had it so long, I don't even celebrate it\nNegative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix\n'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it\n(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')\nDamn, not too many parallels left in our lives\nI mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes\nAnd the squad look bigger to the young guys\nAnd my dick feel better when you drunk, right?\nSpend nighttime starin' at the sunrise\nAnd my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye\nAir Canada Centre nigga when I die\nY'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry\nFirst couple rows, you gon' see the real guys\nThe ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size\nThe ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time\nWatch on my wrist never showed me crunch time\n'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time\nTo be real, man, I never did one crime\nBut none of my brothers could caption that line\nAt all, kill me, that's talent God wasted\nInstant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it\nWhen mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics\nInstant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it\nNow it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted\nNiggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'\nBig body frames, wasn't into car racin'\nMe and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'\nI always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'\nLivin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'\nAfter that, the killers just go into hibernation\n(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')\nDamn, rest in peace Dolla Bill\nHow I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?\nHow I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?\n(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')\nEverybody that survive got survivor's guilt\nMy label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills\nMy boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill\nYou niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk\nAnd your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills\nIt's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)\n[Outro]\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure55Embed"
