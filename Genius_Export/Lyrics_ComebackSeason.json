(dumb)\nYour girl know how I beat it like a flat drum\nAnd spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum\nI fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nOh! Yes!\nI'd like to take this opportunity\nTo formally welcome you to this extravaganza\nThat I call Comeback Season\nHope you enjoy your stay\nDrinks are on me, by the way, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nHow the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?\nI'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up\nI'm perfecting my craft using more cess\nTryna make some cheese off a single is a process\nGet it? Kraft, single, cheese, process\nSit back and admire the talent that I possess\nTop notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city\nBut need to bust out like a model that show chest\nCause you deal with agents from check collections\nI'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction\nAnd baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact\nThat you are les like NextSelection\nThe city is mine, I control this, you know this\nCause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest\nI'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?\nI'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah\nAnd I'mma teach it so you learn right\nYou can't come on this ride, you need to earn height\nWith no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out\nAnd after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah\nYou can't miss the boy\nMe and Rich united like van Nistelrooy\nBar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed\nCause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys\nNo witnesses, no mistresses\nThis the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne\nKeep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me\nYou a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy\nWhat I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for\nI waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four\nYou was playin' Uno, I was doing you know\nWhatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise\n[Outro]\nShout out to 40-40\nYeah my right hand!4Embed"

Go and get you some Fall shit\nSweetie I am a track's demise\nI will kill this song 'til it actually dies\nWith a military jacket and some packed supplies\nI won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive\nAnd all these a-list parties you fraternize\nWhere you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties\nBut you don't never act surprised\nYou just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive\nAnd girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint\nNow it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint\nI gave up a lot to make a progress\nI give it to you, and you take it the best\nYou might also like[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nWhen I give ya what I give ya\n(You gon' like that)\nWhen I give ya what I give ya\n(You throw it right back)\nIt ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)\nI need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)\nAnd when I give ya what I give ya\n(You gon' like that)\nWhen I give ya what I give ya\n(You throw it right back)\nIt ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)\nI need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)\nAnd when I give ya what I give ya\n\n[Verse 2: Trey Songz]\n(It's The Prince, look here)\nYup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again\nCanadian visitor, lady exhibitor\nPlay me I'll visit ya\nLay you in critical, condition\nSo don't get it twisted nigga\nBut back to the pimpin' nigga\nIntercontinental you can catch me laid up\nSomethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt\nThat's why I love what I does\nShot a couple videos now we got the city froze\nSomethin' like my wrist be\nNiggas know how this shit be\nStep into the club security never frisk me\nBuy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free\nI be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes\nTake me where the women be, I won't lose\nDrake take Patr\u00f3n to the face 'til he wasted\nI'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix\nCall me Mr. Anderson huh\nI'm ramblin'\nBut at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme\nBaby what's your name? They call me the game mind\nMost valuable player baby listen it's game time\nWe could take a couple shots break down ya d's\nTake it to the hole post up on me\nLet me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas\nSomethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nWhen I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)\nWhen I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)\nIt ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)\nI need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)\nAnd when I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)\nWhen I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)\nIt ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)\nI need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)\nAnd when I give ya what I give ya1Embed"

Don't hesitate not even for a second\nThe hustle has become an obsession\nI'm on the front line with my weapon\nI am the last hope\n\n[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]\nCan you imagine the last breath of Christ?\nThe last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night\nThe last step that Martin Luther took as a man\nI got the power of my world in my hand\nThe Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye\nI was born to provoke those born to die\nI was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas\nT-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us\nGreatest strugglers hustle to succeed\nCross water smugglers tussle to burn weed\nIt meets that pressure to success in the South\nNiggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth\nI never take back talk, I apply the force\nHand blistering from many years of holding the torch\nWhen the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather\nSo we can keep on hold it forever\nMy name's Kardinall\nYou might also like[Chorus: Andreena Mills]\nI gotta make it out, or move quickly\nCan't allow the past to restrict me\nBut this time around they won't skip me\nI am the last hope.
