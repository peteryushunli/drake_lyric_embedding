Why is it always me?\nGot us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team\n'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas\nGuess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas\nFor real, some nobody started feelin' himself\nA couple somebodies started killin' themself\nA couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf\nI bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help\nI got a gold trophy from the committee for validation\nBad press during the summer over allegations\nI ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money\nThat's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming\nA lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement\nAnd I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear\nFuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga\nFuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous\nWithout me, rap is just a bunch of orphans\nBut if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses\nAnd me and my dread nigga from New Orleans\nStashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings\nEatin' like I\u2019m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's\nNothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco\nThis shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon\nThis shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real\nAll them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills\nAnything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil\nWeezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill\nIf anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real\nComin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase\nBut I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates\nMy weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race\nIt's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe\nNiggas treat me like I've been here for 10\nSome niggas been here for a couple, never been here again\nI'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again\nA young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAyy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again\nIf I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in\nI got her drinkin' with your boy\nI got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah119Embed"

Even Leann Sealy?\"\nThey said, \"Fucking right, they were the first to go\"\nIt's nothing personal\nIt's just that all them women that you slept on been working though\nThey've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up\nWith \"I swear, you don't know this city anymore\nThey might have loved you before\nBut you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you\"\nAh, sure they do, they just not as sincere\nIt's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year\nShe like, \"Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?\"\nWell, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me, who did I leave behind?\nYou think it got to me, I can just read your mind\nYou think I'm so caught up in where I am right now\nUh, but believe I remember it all\n\n[Verse 2]\nI be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit\nNo wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit\nNo wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss\nAnd long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit\nCouple artists got words for me, that's never fun\nThey say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come\nI'm never scared, they never real, I never run\nWhen all is said and done, more is always said than done\nAnd I was told once, things will change\nBy a nigga named Tip when my deal came\nTold me it's all good, even when it feel strange\nNow I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names\nRochelle, Jordan\nThick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand\nHow'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?\nHow'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?\nDamn, my biggest fear is losing it all\nRemember how I used to feel at the start of it\nAnd now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale\nAnd still trying to keep you feeling a part of it\nYeah, just lie to my ears\nTell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear\nLights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas\nAnd I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nTell me, who did I leave behind?\nYou think it got to me, I can just read your mind\nYou think I'm so caught up in where I am right now\nUh, but believe I remember it all\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mother is back to who she was years ago\nIt's like a new page me and her are beginning on\nI wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand\n'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on\nShe thinks I've become a slave to the wealth\nBut I'd never break the promises I made to myself\nAnd I would never make up names for myself\nThen change the names that I just gave to myself\nCertain rappers would call me to say \"What up, though?\"\nI used to brag about it to my friends\nAnd now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat\nAnd maybe that's all they do is just pretend\nDamn, but I bought it though, I believed it\nYeah, I thought it and I achieved it\nYeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love\n'Cause I thought it was all I needed\nYeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along\nAnd this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit\nThey trip off the amount of people that I brought along\nBut I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit\nNeed credentials for every one of these Toronto kids\nI promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live\nI told 'em we about to get it and we finally did\nListen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home\n[Chorus]\nTell me, who did I leave behind?\nYou think it got to me, I can just read your mind\nYou think I'm so caught up in where I am right now\nUh, but believe I remember it all\n\n[Outro: Bob Marley]\nWell, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?\nBut, it\u2019s not copy do it, it\u2019s the feel, you know? It carry a feel\nWell, you ask plenty musicians \u2013 them know it, but them can't do it\nSome people still searching for this truth here57Embed"

When it's all over?\"\nShe asked me\n\"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\"\nI don't wanna think about that right now\nHeat of the moment\nHeat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment\nI ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it\nThe last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it\nCan't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment\n\n[Interlude]\nWhat are we even doing?\n\n[Verse 2]\nRidin' clean\nWith you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things\nYes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord\nI've seen some things\nI wish we had met when I was in my teens\nYes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord\n'Cause these days I only know conditional love\nI'm not used to settlin' down\nI'm too used to switchin' it up, oh\nAnd she says, \"You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him\"\nAnd I say \"Well, goddamn\"\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThen ask myself\nWho am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\nWho am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\nI don't wanna think about that right now\nHeat of the moment\nHeat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment\nI ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it\nThe last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it\nCan't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment\n[Outro: Dennis Graham & Drake]\nAll of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot. \u00a0\nYeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted\u2026\nThey know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. \u00a0\nI agree\nThis shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.

I do not know what to tell you\nI'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening\nI need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself\nI need someone I leave through the front door with\n'Cause we don't wanna hide no more\nPlus you're not shy no more\nNeither of us wanna play the side no more\nNo, I'm not alone\nEven though nothing was the same\nLet me get your ass alone\nLet me make you say my name\nSay my name\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nSay my name, say my name\nWhen no one is around you\nSay, \"Baby, I love you\"\nIf you ain't running games\nSay my name, say my name\nYou actin' kinda shady, baby\nWhy the sudden change?\nSay my name\nSay my name\nSay my name\nSay my name, say my name\nIf no one is around you243Embed"
