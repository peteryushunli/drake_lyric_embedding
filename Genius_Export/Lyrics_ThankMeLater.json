My memory's never faded\nI can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it\nI am still here with who I started with\nThe game needed life, I put my heart in it\nI blew myself up, I'm on some mortar shit\nCarry the weight for my city like a cargo ship\nUh, I'm 23 with a money tree\nGrowing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds\nIt's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist\nAnd that's how she met my pops\nAnd now my garden is enormous\n\"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!\"\nI avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead\nUh-uh, that's word to the millions that they putting up\nI'm trying to do better than good enough\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say \"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nUh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on\nNow that I'm on I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on\nI'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home\nAnd I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone\nBut hit \"re-dial\", you'll see that I just called\nSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and\nPlus, this woman that I messed with unprotected\nTexted saying she wished she would\u2019a kept it\nThe one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it\nMan, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is\nI'm holding on by a thread\nIt's like I'm high right now, the guy right now\nAnd you could tell by looking in my eyes right now\nThat nothing really comes as a surprise right now\n'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say \"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\"You promised me you would never change\"\nUh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI live by some advice this girl Lissa told me\nThe other day Lissa told me that she miss the old me\nWhich made me question when I went missing\nAnd when I start treating my friends different\nMaybe it was the fast paced switch up\nOr the two guns in my face during the stick up\nMaybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted\nWas who set the whole shit up\nBut in fact, I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up\nI know\nBut same time I'm quick to forget\nI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh\n'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\nWill I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?\nYeah, I just need some closure\nAin't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over32Embed"

Well, fuck it, me either\"\nBut point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer\nIt wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds\nWhen I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI know way too many people here right now\nThat I didn't know last year\u2014who the fuck are y'all?\nI swear it feels like the last few nights\nWe've been everywhere and back\nBut I just can't remember it all\nWhat am I doing?

Can you see me? Get your Visine on\nY'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on\nIf you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on\nMan, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?\nI'm really too young to be feeling this old\nIt's about time you admit it, who you kidding?\nMan, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh\n[Chorus]\nI know way too many people here right now\nThat I didn't know last year\u2014who the fuck are y'all?\nI swear it feels like the last few nights\nWe've been everywhere and back\nBut I just can't remember it all\nWhat am I doing?

Can't be\nThey must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free\nYeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner\nGettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner\nJealous dudes get to talkin' in they music\nAnd I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer\nYeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you\nWelcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you\nAnd if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you\nJust know that she gon' tell another nigga\nWhen she through with you\nDon't get impatient when it takes too long\nDrink it all, even when it tastes too strong\nYeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me\nPromise to always give you me, the real me\nYou might also like[Chorus: Drake & Jay-Z]\nWho would've thought I'd be caught in this life?\nLet's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight\nAnd make it all light up\n(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)\nWait until the sun goes down\nWe gon' make this bitch light up\nEven when the sun goes down I'ma make it go\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nOww, hoes turn they heads like owls\nI'm the man of the hour\nTriple entendre, don't even ask me how\nCon Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power\nBright lights'll make your whole city light up\nA trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club\nI just landed in that G450\nCaught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh\nY'all can miss me with the money talk\nThe smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh\nI don't do too much bloggin'\nI just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'\nMm, I ain't got a scar yet\n'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched\nDrake, here's how they gon' come at you\nWith silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you\nIn disguise, in the form of a favor\nThe Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh\nI done seen it all, done it all\nThat's why none of these dum-dums could done him off\nThe summer's ours, the winter too\nTop down in the winter, that's what winners do\nAnd to these niggas I'm like Windows 7\nYou let them tell it, they swear that they invented you\nAnd since no good deed go unpunished\nI'm not as cool with niggas as I once was\nI once was cool as the Fonz was\nBut these bright lights turned me to a monster\nSorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me\nBut I would have went insane had I remained the same me\nFuck niggas! Bitches, too!\nAll I got is this money \u2014 this'll do\n[Chorus: Drake]\nWho would've thought I'd be caught in this life?\nLet's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight\nAnd make it all light up\nWait until the sun goes down\nWe gon' make this bitch light up\nEven when the sun goes down I'ma make it go52Embed"

Or is missing what we had out of the question?\nI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson\nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\nWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes\nThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul\nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\nThat are ready to get married at \"Hello\"\nBecause of what they allowed, where are they all now?\nI know they're somewhere watching\nSo I'm trying to make them proud\nSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me\nThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see\nI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?\nThey say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key\nThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining\nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment\nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded\nAnd the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it\u2013\nI'm sorry\nPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds\nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town\nI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown\nAnd I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down\nI'm in a world where things are taken, never given\nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\nAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\nSo while I'm still here in this position\n[Chorus]\nY-you could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head (Go 'head)\nThank me later, yeah I know what I said (What I said)\nBut later doesn't always come so instead\nIt's okay, you could thank me now\nIt's a- okay (Okay)29Embed"

Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club\nDamn, that nigga always kept it so hood\nBack when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods\nAnd have girls fall through like coins in the couch\nNow we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about\nScared for the first time, everything just clicked\nWhat if I don't really do the numbers they predict?\nConsidering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked\nTo write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick\nBut if I really do it don't expect to get a split\nCause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get\nI'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in\nThrowing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen\nBut still throwing touchdown passes\nIn tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it\nPeople say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it\nBut they need to be a little more specific\nIs this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression\nDucking your questions, fuck your suggestions\nMoney gets all of my love and affection\nCars all black like the cover of Essence\nI'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze\nY.M.O.E. nigga, yeah\nYou might also like[Outro]\nUh, yeah, this what yall want\nOctobers Very Own\nYoung Money\nATF\nThank me later in this bitch wasssup\nFree Weezy in this bitch wasup\nJune 15th in this bitch wasup\nNoel That\u2019s it Ahhhhhh51Embed"
