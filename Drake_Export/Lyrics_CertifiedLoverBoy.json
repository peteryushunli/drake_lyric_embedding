(Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nAll the things I've done up until right now (Right now)\nI need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)\nWriting down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)\nDon't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you\nHow much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nTried to run it back a hundred times\nThe world is yours, but the city's mine\nI can't believe you put it on your mother's life\nI can't believe you told me it was ride or die\n'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive\nTrue enough I know you from the other side\nI set my expectations way too high\nYeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night\nAngel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night\nI know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all\nJust to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights\nWhy does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?\nThat nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice\nAnd I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you\nI was on your ass like back pockets\nNiggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?\nSo much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face\n'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face\nYou're the reason we'll be going separate ways\nYou're the reason we cannot communicate\nIt's not the things you say, it's what you don't say\nI'm not in your way, you're in your own way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I don't get how you're yelling at me\nHow much I gotta spend for you to pipe down?

That's a hard one\nThe finish line is where I like to pull up and start from\nPain is just a place that I go to get the bars from\nAnxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done\nDelusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from\nMy son is the one thing I hate to be apart from\nBet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from\nI know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from\nBut I still don't know where I get the calm from\n(Where I get the calm from) Yeah\nYou might also like[Interlude]\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)\nYeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nWoah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah\nYeah (Woah, woah)\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes\nI told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied\nI be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line\nAnd I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline\nSometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind\nI can't even hear myself when I get quiet time\nLike, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?\nThey've been tryna push a narrative since '09\nAnd they even had my ass convinced a couple times\nBut that ain't even the half, I had tougher times\nOnly look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes\nAnd it's whatever with them niggas on the other side\nWe got problems we could never really put aside\nI cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside\nI tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die\nSo now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)\nMy hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off\nI'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff\nHouses paid off, label paid off\nMy soul for the money wasn't the trade-off\nUnlike most of you boys that fade off\nI feel guilty taking some days off\nPlease don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off\nI mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with\nI'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off\nTrust me it was nothin' light, holmes\nThey tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home\nI know you love me\nCan't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on\nUnless Kawhi wanna run it back\nOther than that, the strings'll be unattached\nCertified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that\nY'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back\nAnd you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters\nSaid you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard\nOh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more\nSoft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it\nI'm always tryna rekindle\nFrom the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?\nFrom the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter\nTo my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter\nFor the young Gs out here starting from the beginning\nNobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)\n[Outro]\nWoah, woah, woah-woah\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah-woah, woah\nWoah, woah, ah\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nYeah (Ooh, yeah)\nSaid it's hard when it starts to fade away\nHard when it starts to fade away\nIt's hard when the memories start to fade away\nSaid its hard when the memories start to fade away\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Ooh, ooh) So beautiful\nYeah, yeah, yeah16Embed"
