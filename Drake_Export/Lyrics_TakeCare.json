How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit\nI could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts\nBut I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about\nRap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'\nRappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear\nIt's been two years since somebody asked me who I was\nI'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was\nThat's what's important, what really happened before this\nWhen me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans\nSinging, \"Walking like a man, finger on the trigger\nI got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,\" ah\nWith fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves\nI was pushing myself to get something that I deserve\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance\nSometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance\nTell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good\nDo me like the women from my town would\nLeather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors\nTalking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for\nMemphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back\nIn Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack\nAnd these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth\nAnd they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South\nAnd every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like\nSo why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?\nSo I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade\nSoon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid\nAnd if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball\nI'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that\nMaking major changes to the life I'm livin'\nI had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways\n[Chorus]\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)63Embed"

The drink here? The girls here?\nWell, fuck, let's get it then\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nUh, I'm trying to let go of the past\nShould we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah\nBecause it's hard to say no (Say no)\nYeah, it gets hard to say no\nAre you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down\nEvery time (Every time, every time, every time)\nAm I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down\nWe'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)\nAre you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down\nEvery time (Every time, every time, every time)\nAm I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down\nWe'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Drake]\nYeah\nUsed to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man\nLoved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh\nYou keep talking how you was this and you had this\nAnd you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?\nGot a show up in your city, your girl is in the line\nAnd the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time\nYou should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now\nI wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now\nLet's be real about this shit, can I take you home?\nOr come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?\nI heard you got your ways, I never would have known\nShe says, \"You're such a dog,\" I say, \"You're such a bone\"\nI've been everywhere, where you know me from?\nThese days, women give it to me like they owe me one\nBut they crave attention, though, they always saying, \"Show me some\"\nBut girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh\nAt least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that\nThen, fuck, let's get it then\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nUh, I'm trying to let go of the past\nShould we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah\nBecause it's hard to say no (Say no)\nYeah, it gets hard to say no\nAre you down? Are you down?

Lipstick on the glass\nSee, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time\nWe must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind\nYou got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)\n[Verse 4: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nShower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in a corner\nLike a lab rat, nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in a Boise state\nCan't see a play or the team, 'cause\nEverybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, \"That ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what y'all can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you, baby\n\"Someone Like You,\" more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy\nOh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy\nPlease be careful, bitches got the rabies85Embed"

Should I pinch you?\nAfter all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've done for me now, yeah\nYou knew that I was gon' be somethin'\nWhen you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've, look what you've\n[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]\nHi Aubrey\nI'm here sitting with my son having a little talk\nAnd he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now\nTo let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this\nIn this comfortable place\nAll I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together\nAnd the times I used to look after you\nAnd I still have wonderful feeling about that\nSo God bless you\nAnd I hope I'll see you109Embed"

Time for me to revisit the past\nThere's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved\nThere's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn\nInterviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nUh, so much for being optimistic\nThey say love is in the air, so I\nHold my breath 'til my face turn purple\nKeep a few bad bitches in my circle\nMy nuts hang like ain't no curfew\nBitch, if you wave, then I will surf you\nI flew jet, she flew commercial\nBut we still met later that night\nAfter my session, she came over\nI was aggressive and she was sober\nI gave her a pill, she started confessin'\nAnd started undressin' and asked me to hold her\nAnd so I did, but that was last month\nAnd now she's texting me asking for closure, damn\nShe say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper\nWe eat each other whenever we at the dinner table\nShe say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average\nShit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married\nPromises, I hope I never break 'em\nMet a female dragon, had a fire conversation\nBut interviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nYeah\nYeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah178Embed"

The ride\nWhy won't it stop? Ooh, the ride\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nYou won't feel me 'til you want it so bad, you tell yourself you're in it\nAnd tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished\nAnd steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image\nAnd ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted\nYou need a minute? You got it\nYou know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights\nThe sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life\nApartment 1503, some couches and paintings\nWhere you record with two others that want the same things\nYeah, it start to feel better than home feels\nAnd so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close\nThat champagne money was for gas and phone bills\nBut shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most\nYou drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga\nAnd come out every night to let the city see they nigga\nTellin' stories that nobody relate to\nAnd even though they hate you\nThey just keep on tellin' you they feel you, nigga\nYeah\nIt's been too long, man\n[Chorus: The Weeknd & Drake]\nI've been faded too long, ooh\nI've been faded too long, ooh\nI've been faded too long, ooh\nWhy won't it stop? (Yeah), the ride\nWhy won't it stop? (Uh), ooh, the ride\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nI haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long\nI'm drivin' right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on\nThat runway can be cold, especially after summer's rolled on\nAnd all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs\nFor four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home?\nWhat's good at home?\nThe same hoes are still at it, I should've known\nMy young niggas poppin' M's and sippin' dirty Jones\nProblem children that all be reppin' October's Own\nBrand new girl and she still growin'\nBrand new titties, stitches still showin'\nYeah, and she just prayin' that it heals good\nI'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin' that it feels good\nI really don't know much, but, shit, I know a secret\nThey say more money, more problems, my nigga, don't believe it\nI mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin'\nBut I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin'\nYoung money-maker, season-ticket holder\nSeason switching over\nI come through them bitches, still scorchin' as if I didn't notice\nYou niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda\nI'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater\nLook at that fuckin' chip on your nephew's shoulder\nMy sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it\nMy junior and senior will only get meaner\nTake care, nigga\n[Outro: The Weeknd]\nOoh\nI'm still faded, faded, faded (The ride)\nI'm still faded, faded, faded (Why won't it stop?
